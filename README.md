Summary
-------

A graph datastructure for the LaTeX3 programming environment


Prerequisites
-------------

To use this package, you need the following packages:

*  `xparse`
*  `withargs`

The following package is optional, loaded only when lt3graph
is loaded with the 'display' option, for displaying graph info
in a table:

*  `xcolor`

To generate the documentation some additional packages are needed.


Installation
-------------

`lt3graph.sty` is provided directly in the package archive. Put
it in a place where your LaTeX distribution can find it.

(`lt3graph.sty` is not generated, but manually maintained; you
 may use docstrip to remove the documentation, but you don't
 have to; it will just work the way it is)


Documentation
-------------

`lt3graph.pdf` is provided directly in the package archive. To
generate the documentation yourself, run LaTeX on lt3graph.tex.

(`lt3graph.tex` does not contain the package code itself; it inputs
 `lt3graph.sty` directly to document the implementation)
